# Description
Eclipticon is a testing and development software tool to help users optimize for concurrency. This tool will be in the form of an Eclipse plugin and will be targeted to a specific group of users that is developers and testers of concurrent software. The goal of the tool is to ease difficulties that arise when using concurrency in the Java programming language.

The user can specify these instrumentation points either manually or automatically. The automatic generation of these test areas will be random, though following some user‚Äêadjustable configurations. The testing will occur by inserting thread delays that will cause the newly instrumented code to explore a larger set of thread interleavings.
